      "duration": "Jun 2022 - Jun 2024",
      "challenges": "Liberty Mutual is a large company with various departments, and each department or project has implemented its own business logic and technology stack. In one project, you might find a React implementation, while another could use Angular. You could also come across Vue.js or even plain Vanilla JavaScript. <br/><br /> Over time, the look and feel (the UI implementation) have evolved, leading to inconsistencies. The challenge is that Liberty Mutual’s brand identity, including its UI, has also evolved and changed over time, creating further discrepancies.",
      "solutions": "Liberty Mutual needed a solution to manage all its brand identity in one centralized place. To achieve this, they created an in-house UI library to be used company-wide. This library was built using web component technology, which is agnostic and native, allowing it to be supported across any framework or technology, such as React, Angular, Vue, or plain JavaScript.",
      "contributions": "As a Senior Software Engineer, I designed and built several web components for this UI library. One of the components I’m most proud of is the stepper component, which has become one of the most widely used across projects.",

      "duration": "Jun 2021 - May 2022",
      "challenges": "Build a new Avaya design system. Initially, this project began as a CSS file with custom styles, which was widely adopted across company projects. However, this solution proved impractical because it lacked HTML implementation. For example, a major challenge was creating HTML that adhered to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) set by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). These guidelines outline best practices for color contrast, heading structures, clear link text, and the proper use of ARIA attributes to enhance screen reader functionality.<br><br> Without a structured approach, developers struggled to implement and test these accessibility requirements in their projects. This not only increased development time but also diverted focus away from working on core business logic.",
      "solutions": "Developed a React-based UI component library that incorporates accessibility standards (A11Y). This approach enables developers to speed up the development process while ensuring compliance with accessibility guidelines.",
